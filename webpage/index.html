          <h3 class="post-title">Becoming a web developer</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>
              A jornada para o web dev continua. Para ser sincero, lidar com
              back-end tem sido mais complexo do que eu achei que seria, mas
              acredito que com o tempo irei me adaptar melhor às adversidades e
              me tornarei um programador. No momento estou fazendo este primeiro
              site para internalizar os conhecimentos que tenho.
            </p>
            <p>
              No momento de criação deste site, ainda sei bem pouco de
              javascript. Espero que quando eu olhe para ele daqui a algum
              tempo, eu tenha algum sentimento de nostalgia (e tambem de
              maestria em javascript).

          <h3 class="post-title">Construindo bases</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>
              Lembrei que tinha feito esse blog como projeto de um aplicativo de programação que eu estava
              fazendo, e então salvei no github para ter a memória do primeiro projeto. Hoje, ao fazer meu
              primeiro projeto real world, me deu uma vontade de dar uma leve atualizada neste blog que eu comecei fiz há um tempo, então nada mais interessante do que colocar o que eu aprender de novo nele, não?

            </p>
            <p>
              Os conhecimentos do meu eu do passado eram fracos em javascript e até o dia de hoje estão, mas para ser sincero, me sinto bem quanto as bases que estou desenvolvendo.
              Bom, assumo que estava nervoso quanto a minha lentidão de aprendizado, mas comecei a me sentir melhor após entender com com mais facilidade como o DOM funciona. Bem, ainda estou no início, mas ao longo do tempo acredito que me sentirei mais confortável.
              Minha meta para o futuro é me tornar full stack ainda na faculdade.

          <h3 class="post-title">Regular expressions & life</h3>
          <p>So, after almost two months since my last update, i've decided that i'm going to save some of my knowledge here, because i may need it in the future (which i'm almost certain of).
            Anyway, Regular expressions have too many stuff to remember, so i realized that i'm not able to remember everything. At least, not for now. And honestly, i dont even know at the moment what's the real use of regex.
            Okay, let me begin my resume.
            Oh, actually let me create a quick update of what's going on in my student life for now.
            Well, i realized in the beginning of december that was taking too long to get out of the very basics, and after thinking about it for a while, i noticed that i was afraid of getting further, since for a long time in my life i felt less capable than other people.
            After thinking about this, i started to study faster, so i'm trying to finish my javascript course untill the end of February, wich i think that is very possible. And this is because studying how to code gets easier. i was very afraid that it wouldn't get, but it did!
            at the end of december i've seen a video about cs50 web(cs50, if you dont know, r harvard programming courses). Well, the certificate in BRL is about (with dolar current quotation) 1024 R$. But gladly there's a student's support staff.
            After writing the reason's why i should have a discount, i got a response after 2 days, and in 31 of december i received a 90% discount! It made me the most happier person in the world. Struggling for too many years (at least for me) and then getting an oportunity like this... it made me too happy.
            Well, after this resume, let me get to the point:
          </p>
          <p style= "text-align:center; font-size: 30px;">REGULAR EXPRESSIONS</p>

          <p>The <strong>.test()</strong>str method takes the regex, applies it to a string (which is placed inside the parentheses), and returns true or false if your pattern finds something or not. <br>
             You can also extract the actual matches you found with the <strong>.match()</strong> method. <br>
             To search or extract a pattern more than once, you can use the <strong>g</strong> flag. <br> 
             Sometimes you won't (or don't need to) know the exact characters in your patterns.The wildcard character <strong>.</strong> will match any one character. ex: /.un/ returns: sun,run,fun,bun etc. <br>
            You can search for multiple patterns using the alternation or OR operator: <strong>|</strong>. ex:<strong>/yes|no|maybe/</strong> ; <br>
            
             But sometimes, you might want to also match case differences, in this situation you can use the i flag. ex: /ignorecase/<strong>i</strong>; <br>
            You can search for a literal pattern with some flexibility with character classes. Character classes allow you to define a group of characters you wish to match by placing them inside square <strong>([ and ])</strong> brackets. ex: /b[aiu]g/; <br>
            Inside a character set, you can define a range of characters to match using a hyphen character: <strong>-</strong>. ex: /[a-e]at/;<br>
            Using the hyphen (-) to match a range of characters is not limited to letters. It also works to match a range of numbers. ex: <strong>let myRegex = /[a-z0-9]/ig;</strong><br>
            To create a negated character set, you place a caret character (^) after the opening bracket and before the characters you do not want to match. ex: <strong>/[^aeiou]/gi</strong><br>
            You can use the + character to check if that is the case. Remember, the character or pattern has to be present consecutively. That is, the character has to repeat one after the other. ex: <strong>/a+/g</strong>;<br>
            There's also an option that matches characters that occur zero or more times. ex: <strong>let goRegex = /go*/;</strong>.<br>
            In regular expressions, a greedy match finds the longest possible part of a string that fits the regex pattern and returns it as a match. The alternative is called a lazy match, which finds the smallest possible part of the string that satisfies the regex pattern. ex: <strong>t[a-z]*?i/ returns ["ti"].</strong><br>
            <br><br>
            Outside of a character set, the caret is used to search for patterns at the beginning of strings. ex: <strong>let calRegex = /^Cal/;</strong>
            You can search the end of strings using the dollar sign character $ at the end of the regex. ex: <strong>let storyRegex = /story$/;</strong>
            To look for one or more characters:<strong>+</strong> .<br>
          To match for zero or more characters: <strong>*</strong>.<br>
          If you want to match a certain range of patterns with quantity specifiers (Quantity specifiers are used with curly brackets ({ and }). Example:<strong> /Oh{3,6}\sno/</strong>;<br>
          Sometimes you only want to specify the lower number of patterns with no upper limit: <strong>/haz{4,}ah/</strong> ;<br>
          You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns with quantity specifiers using curly brackets:<strong>/tim{4}ber/</strong> ;<br>
          Sometimes the patterns you want to search for may have parts of it that may or may not exist: <strong>/favou?rite/;</strong> <br>
          How to match white space: <strong>\s</strong> .<br>
          How to match everything but white space: <strong>\S</strong>. <br>
          The closest character class in JavaScript to match the alphabet is <strong>\w</strong>. This shortcut is equal to [A-Za-z0-9_]. This character class matches upper and lowercase letters plus numbers. ex: <strong>/[\w+]/g</strong> <br>
          You can search for the opposite of the \w with <strong>\W</strong>. Note, the opposite pattern uses a capital letter. This shortcut is the same as [^A-Za-z0-9_]. <br>
          The shortcut to look for digit characters is <strong>\d</strong>, with a lowercase d. This is equal to the character class <strong>[0-9]</strong> , which looks for a single character of any number between zero and nine. <br>
          The shortcut to look for non-digit characters is <strong>\D</strong> . This is equal to the character class <strong>[^0-9]</strong> , which looks for a single character that is not a number between zero and nine.  <br>
          Sometimes we want to check for groups of characters using a Regular Expression and to achieve that we use parentheses <strong>()</strong>.If you want to find either Penguin or Pumpkin in a string, you can use the following Regular Expression: <strong>/P(engu|umpk)in/g</strong>. <strong>/(Franklin|Eleanor) .*Roosevelt/g;</strong> <br> 
          <strong>Regular Expressions: Reuse Patterns Using Capture Groups.</strong> To specify where that repeat string will appear, you use a backslash (\) and then a number. This number starts at 1 and increases with each additional capture group you use. An example would be \1 to match the first group. <br>
          Searching is useful. However, you can make searching even more powerful when it also changes (or replaces) the text you match.You can search and replace text in a string using .replace() on a string.  ex: "Code Camp".replace(/(\w+)\s(\w+)/, '$2 $1');     <br>
          <br> <br>
          Lookaheads are patterns that tell JavaScript to look-ahead in your string to check for patterns further along. A positive lookahead will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is there, but won't actually match it. A positive lookahead is used as <strong>(?=...)</strong>  where the  <strong>...</strong> is the required part that is not matched. On the other hand, a negative lookahead will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is not there <strong>(?!...)</strong>.  <br>
            
          <br><br> test example: Use lookaheads in the pwRegex to match passwords that are greater than 5 characters long, do not begin with numbers, and have two consecutive digits. <br>
            answer: <strong>let pwRegex = /^\D(?=\w{5,})(?=\w*\d{2})/;</strong>

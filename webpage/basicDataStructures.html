        Basic Data Structures: Add Items to an Array with push() and
        unshift()</strong
      >
      -> push() method adds elements to the end of an array, and unshift() adds
      elements to the beginning.

        >Basic Data Structures: Remove Items from an Array with pop() and
        shift() </strong
      >Both push() and unshift() have corresponding methods that are nearly
      functional opposites: pop() and shift(). As you may have guessed by now,
      instead of adding, pop() removes an element from the end of an array,
      while shift() removes an element from the beginning.
      <strong>Basic Data Structures: Remove Items Using splice() </strong>
      -> splice() can take up to 3 parameters, but for now, we'll focus on just
      the first 2. The first two parameters of splice() are integers which
      represent indexes, or positions, of the array that splice() is being
      called upon. And remember, arrays are zero-indexed, so to indicate the
      first element of an array, we would use 0. splice()'s first parameter
      represents the index on the array from which to begin removing elements,
      while the second parameter indicates the number of elements to delete.

      <strong>Basic Data Structures: Add Items Using splice() </strong>Remember
      in the last challenge we mentioned that splice() can take up to three
      parameters? Well, you can use the third parameter, comprised of one or
      more element(s), to add to the array. This can be incredibly useful for
      quickly switching out an element, or a set of elements, for another. ex:
      arr.splice(0,2,'DarkSalmon','BlanchedAlmond');

      Debugging is basically the way for you to know if your code has any...
      bugs. There are a few ways to discover, with the most common one being
      utilizing console.log() in strategic points.
      <br />
      Besides console.log(), there's console.clear(), which clear all previous
      console.logs you may have used before.
      <br />
      You can use "typeof" to check the data structure.console.log(typeof "");
      // outputs "string" | console.log(typeof 0); // outputs "number" |
      console.log(typeof []); // outputs "object" | console.log(typeof {}); //
      outputs "object".
      <br />
      JavaScript allows the use of both single (') and double (") quotes to
      declare a string. Deciding which one to use generally comes down to
      personal preference, with some exceptions.Of course, it is okay to use
      only one style of quotes. You can escape the quotes inside the string by
      using the backslash (\) escape character.
      <br />
      As covered before, the assignment operator (=) in JavaScript assigns a
      value to a variable name. And the == and === operators check for equality
      (the triple === tests for strict equality, meaning both value and type are
      the same).
      <br />
      Off by one errors (sometimes called OBOE) crop up when you're trying to
      target a specific index of a string or array (to slice or access a
      segment), or when looping over the indices of them. JavaScript indexing
      starts at zero, not one, which means the last index is always one less
      than the length of the item. If you try to access an index equal to the
      length, the program may throw an "index out of range" reference error or
      print undefined.
